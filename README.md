# Slam outdoor project
## Vision
SL4M-outdoor

SLAM(Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) is a technology that allows you to determine the location of an object and at the same time create a map of the surrounding area. Nowadays this technology is used in many areas, such as virtual and augmented reality, robotics, Medical equipment and in many others. We will implement outdoor SLAM(works in OpenSpace) that uses only one camera and zero sensors, but also indoor SLAM(CloseSpace) exists.

There are different types of SLAMs are existing:
  - Lidar Slam - uses laser scanners to measure distances to objects.
  - Visual SLAM - uses cameras to collect data.  There are Stereo and Mono SLAMS.
  - Stereo SLAM - uses multiple cameras to obtain information.
  - Mono SLAM - uses one camera to obtain information.

Our team will solve the problem of creating a map using a video from any moving object, for example a car, bicycle, scooter, with a video camera attached to it.
The goal of our project is to write software that will process the video
and build a map of the area using it.
We will use C++ as the main programming language and the OpenCV library to implement SLAM, Notion will also be used for task tracking.
